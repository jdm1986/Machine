# Machine
C#/.NET Project

This project is the solution to a problem that regularly arises at my company. If someone wants to rent a piece of equipment, there are a few methods to figure out what's available, but the most immediate solution is to walk out and look in the yard to see what's there. It would be nice to have an application in which users at the shop, as well as salespeople on the road, would be able to determine what is and is not available. 'Machine' is an equipment inventory CRUD app that allows users to distinguish and determine whether a piece of equipment is on rent or not.
